## **🚀 Select Your Colony Destination 🌌**

**Welcome to Select Your Colony Destination — a space colonization strategy game prototype built for the NASA Space Apps Challenge!
🌍 Choose your world wisely and build a thriving colony using real NASA planetary data.**

## 🌟 Core Features & Gameplay

_Pick from iconic worlds like Mars, Moon, Venus, Europa, Titan, and more!
Each world comes with unique challenges based on gravity, temperature, atmosphere, and resource availability — all modeled from real NASA research._

## 🔋 Resource Management

_Manage vital resources to keep your colony alive:_

- Oxygen 🫁
- Power ⚡
- Water 💧
- Food 🌾
- Population 👥

**_Keep your colony balanced — resources are consumed daily and produced by your buildings._**

##🏗️ Buildings & Construction

_Choose from various modules:_
- Habitat Modules 🏠
- Solar Arrays ☀️
- Nuclear Reactors ☢️
- Ice Extractors ❄️
- Greenhouses 🌱
...and more!

**_Each building has costs and produces or consumes resources — plan carefully to survive!_**

## ⏳ Day-by-Day Simulation

_Time advances every 1.5 seconds — watch your colony grow or struggle as resources fluctuate and colonists consume supplies._

## 🎯 Win & Lose Conditions

_Win by reaching a target population of 30 colonists! 🎉

Lose if oxygen, water, or food drop to zero with people still alive 😵._

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- Built with React using hooks (useState, useEffect) for smooth gameplay and state management.
- Modular design: ResourcePanel, BuildingMenu, GameBoard, PlanetSelector.
- Real-time updates simulate daily resource changes and consumption.
- Data-driven: planetary and building stats loaded from external files for easy expansion.
- Integrates Figma assets for logos and UI design 🎨.
- Uses lucide-react icons for clean, modern interface elements.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. Select a planet and start your colony with initial resources based on real NASA data.

2. Build structures by selecting from the menu and placing them on the surface — costs deducted immediately.

3. Watch daily cycles update resources and population, with modifiers based on environmental factors.

4. Balance growth and consumption to avoid resource collapse and ensure your colony thrives!

## 📸 Visuals & Design

- Authentic NASA and DeITa logos from Figma.
- Clean UI with dynamic resource displays and alerts.
- Responsive layout optimized for easy gameplay.
